To train the falppy bird, first you need to clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/hardikbansal/Qlearning```

Once you have cloned the directory, change the directory to flappy bird directory

```cd Qlearning/Flappy```

You need to have the following python dependencies installed before running the script

1. Latest version of Tensorflow
2. Following libraris installed:
      
      1. opencv-python
      2. pygame
      3. imageio
      4. scipy

If you have all these installed, you can run the training function as follow:

```python flappy_dqn_gym.py```
